                <h2 class="subtitle">Why Shifly?</h2>
                <p>Meet <strong>Shifly</strong>, the ultimate mobile app for Shift Managers, at McDonalds, designed to simplify your day and boost efficiency. Shifly streamlines your entire shift, starting with a user-friendly <strong>floorplan</strong> to effortlessly place your crew. It then creates a detailed, organized <strong>breaklist</strong> and a clear "Next In" screen, so you're always on top of staffing.</p>
                <p>Shifly's innovative <strong>Travel Path</strong> guides you through the store, helping you conduct food safety checks and assign tasks to maintain a clean and safe environment. With its built-in task list, you can input your own duties, and the app will automatically display in a list. Critical daily food safety task will display at your exact location.</p>
                <p>Stay ahead with intelligent <strong>notifications</strong>: get a 15-minute advance alert for each crew member's shift end, including their station, giving you ample time to plan coverage. You'll also receive a two-hour notification reminder to perform another food safety travel path.</p>
                <p>Built on <strong>Kotlin Multiplatform</strong>, Shifly provides a seamless experience across all devices, from Android tablets to iPhones. But on Android devices, it truly shines by leveraging <strong>Material You</strong> to create a personalized color theme that adapts to your phone's wallpaper, making the app feel uniquely yours.</p>

                    <p class="feature_description">During your shift, there are numerous tasks and distractions to manage. Shifty will provide notifications to keep you informed about upcoming events, ensuring you stay on track.</p>
                    <p class="feature_description">As a crew member nearing the end of your shift, you will receive a 15-minute notification to allow you to plan your coverage. This will prevent awkward situations where you discover you have missed one crew member.</p>
                    <p class="feature_description">Food safety is paramount in maintaining a safe working environment. Shifty will remind you to complete another food safety check 2 hours after last completion, assisting you in identifying any potential issues promptly.</p>

                    <p class="feature_description">Upon reviewing the dates in the food safety section, Shifly will highlight the dates that expire today, indicating to the shift manager that they should notify the next manager or take appropriate action to dispose of the products.</p>
                    <p class="feature_description">This feature provides Business Managers with assurance that Shift Managers are dedicating time to verify dates and can access the dates through the application to ensure accuracy with what is physically present on the store's floor.</p>

Upon successful completion of these tasks, Shifly will organise the necessary actions for you, allowing you to delegate Crew or Managers to rectify any issues and ensure your store is food safe.</p>
                    <p class="feature_description">As you progress through your travel path, Shifly will prompt you to complete another travel path within a two-hour timeframe.

                <h2 class="subtitle">Disclaimer</h2>
                <p>Shifly operates optimally on Android devices and iPads. However, due to the stringent application management policies of iOS, iPhones may unexpectedly terminate Shifly, resulting in data loss for the shift.</p>
                <p>Although we strongly advise <strong>against</strong> using Shifly on iPhones, it is recommended to <em>keep Shifly visible at all times</em> to prevent iPhone from terminating Shifly. If multitasking is necessary, periodically reopen Shifly to prevent iPhone from shutting down Shifly. We recommend using only <strong>one</strong> application before returning to Shifly.</p>
                <p>Shifly <strong>does not</strong> retain any data. Upon completing your shift, close the application, and it will automatically wipe all data, preparing it for your next shift. Additionally, Shifly <strong>does not</strong> communicate with any external servers.</p>

                <p>Shifly is not yet at the stage of release. We may allow a select group to test Shifly. As of the time of writing, Shifly is only a personal project to demonstrate my skills and understanding from Google's Course 'Android Basic with Compose' and self-learning of Kotlin Multiplatform.</p>
                <p>There are many issues that need to be resolved before any form of testing can commence. Many areas are merely placeholders for future ideas.</p>
                <p>If demand increases, the project development will become a higher priority.</p>
