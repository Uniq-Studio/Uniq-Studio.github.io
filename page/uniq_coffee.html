                <p>Meet <strong>Uniq Coffee</strong>, the simplified mobile app for buying your next caffeinated drink. Uniq Coffee streamlines the coffee ordering experience, starting with setting up your <strong>Uniq ID</strong> to save your data for quicker checkout. You then can start your order and <em>quickly</em> get to the payment screen. After <strong>10 purchases</strong>, you get a <strong>free</strong> coffee on your next purchase!</p>
                <p>Uniq Coffee's interface is designed to be <strong>clean</strong> and <strong>efficient</strong>. Orders can be placed in just a few <strong>seconds</strong>, while <em>expandable</em> info boxes give you detailed insights about calorie content and milk options—so you always know exactly what you’re getting.</p>
                <p>The <strong>Stamp Card</strong> is always visible on the home screen, letting you track your rewards at a glance. A progress bar <em>encourages</em> you to grab that next coffee and unlock your <strong>complimentary</strong> drink even sooner.</p>
                <p>Built on <strong>Kotlin with Compose</strong>, Uniq Coffee provides a beautiful experience across all Android devices. It truly shines by leveraging <strong>Material You</strong> to create a personalized color theme that adapts to your phone's wallpaper, making the app feel uniquely yours.</p>

                    <p class="feature_description">The Out-of-Box Experience begins with Uniq Coffee asking for your name and preferred payment method. This helps personalize the app for you right from the start. Your name is used to greet you on the Home Screen and to identify your coffee orders, making the experience feel more personal.</p>
                    <p class="feature_description">Adding a payment method during setup is optional, but you'll need one at checkout—either your saved method or Google Pay—to complete your purchase.</p>
                    <p class="feature_description">You can update or change your payment details anytime in the Settings menu, keeping your Uniq ID up to date.</p>

                    <p class="feature_description">Nothing important is hidden or removed. All the information you need is either right in front of you or just a single tap away, making the process effortless.</p>
                    <p class="feature_description">With a clean, intuitive layout, there's no more confusing navigation. You can find what you want instantly and place your order in seconds, so your coffee is always just within reach.</p>
